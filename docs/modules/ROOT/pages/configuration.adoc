= Policy Configuration

When `ec` command line requires configuration, e.g. for `ec validate image`
command, the configuration can be provided as an inline JSON or YAML string,
such as in this example:

[,bash]
----
ec validate image --policy '{
    "configuration": {
        "collections": ["minimal"]
    }
    "sources": [
        {
            "policy": ["oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-release-policy:latest"],
            "data": ["oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-policy-data:latest"]
        }
    ]
}' ...
----

The configuration can be provided as a reference to a
xref:ecc:ROOT:reference.adoc[EnterpriseContractPolicy] Kubernetes custom
resource by either name (e.g. "my-policy") in the current namespace, or by
providing namespace and the name separaded by slash (`/`) character, such as in
this example:

[,bash]
----
ec validate image --policy my-namespace/my-policy
----

If the explicit policy is not provided via the `--policy` parameter, the default
policy named `default` is loaded from `enterprise-contract-service` namespace of
the cluster accessed using the current Kubernetes client configuration.

== Including and excluding rules

By default, all rules are included.

You can modify the defaults by setting `config.policy.include` and
`config.policy.exclude`. Each of those values should be a list of strings.

The strings in the list should be one of the the following:

A "package name"::

Package names can be found in the policy documentation, for example the
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#attestation_type_package[Attestation Type] package
name is `attestation_type`. Specifing a package name by itself in the include
or exclude list means every rule from that package should be included or
excluded.

A "rule name"::

A rule name consists of the rule's package name and the rule's "code" separated
by a dot. Rule codes can be see in the documentation also. For example the
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#attestation_type__unknown_att_type[Unknown attestation type found] rule
name is `attestation_type.unknown_att_type`.

A "package name:term"::

Some policy rules process a list of items, "term" allows a particular item to
be excluded or included. This matcher behaves like "package name" but only
applies to policy rules in the package that match the "term". For example, the
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#test_package[Test package] emits results for each
test case. A particular test case can be ignored without ignoring the remaining
ones.

A "rule name:term"::

This is similar to "package name:term", but allows finer granularity by only
applying to a particular policy rule within the package.

"*"::

The `"\*"` acts as a wildcard to match any package. Note that it does not match
partial names, so you can't specify `"s*"` to match every package starting with
"s" for example.

You can also specify `"<packagename>.*"` and it works the same as just
`"<packagename>"` to represent every rule in a package.

== Examples

The examples here are shown as the contents of `config.policy` formatted as
YAML for brevity and readability.

Note that you can omit fields where the default value is what you need.

=== Excluding rules from particular packages

This would include all rules except for rules from the two specified packages.
All other rules would be included.

[source,yaml]
----
exclude:
- attestation_task_bundle
- slsa_build_scripted_build
----

=== Including only rules from a particular package

This would include just the rules from the specified packages and exclude all
other rules.

[source,yaml]
----
include:
- test
- java
----

=== Excluding just one rule

This would include all rules except for the `unacceptable_task_bundle` rule in
the `attestation_task_bundle` package. The other rules in the
`attestation_task_bundle` would be included.

[source,yaml]
----
exclude:
- attestation_task_bundle.unacceptable_task_bundle
----

=== Specifying that certain tests should be non-blocking

This example shows how to specify that the Enterprise Contract is allowed to
pass even if certain tests failed or didn't complete.

[source,yaml]
----
exclude:
- test:get-clair-scan
- test:clamav-scan
----

=== Including only some rules from a package

You can specify both `include` and `exclude` to pick out just the
rules you want.

This example specifies that only the `unacceptable_task_bundle` rule from the
`attestation_task_bundle` package should be included. The other rules in the
`attestation_task_bundle` would be excluded.

Notice the higher specificity include rule takes precedence over the exclude
rule in this example.

[source,yaml]
----
include:
- "*"
- attestation_task_bundle.unacceptable_task_bundle
exclude:
- attestation_task_bundle.*
----

== Specifying a predefined set of rules with `collections`

Rather than specifying the values of `include` and `exclude`
explicitly, you can also select from a set of predefined configurations by
setting `"data.config.policy.collections"`. For example, in a `data/config.json`
file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "config": {
    "policy": {
      "collections": ["some_things", "some_other_things"]
    }
  }
}
----

== Data Sources

Some of the Enterprise Contract policy rules, defined in the ec-policies git
repository, rely on certain data values when evaluated. For example, a policy
rule exists to ensure all the parent container images used during the build
process have been retrieved from an acceptable registry. The list of acceptable
registries is a data value. This type of data is called Rule Data.

In addition to policy rules, the ec-policies git repository also defines values
for Rule Data, see
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:attachment$rule_data.yml[rule_data.yml]
. As a user, you can provide a custom data source with modified Rule Data
allowing the same policy rules to be used to best fit your use cases.

There are different ways to create a custom data source. The simplest form is to
fork the ec-policies git repository and change the values of
`data/rule_data.yml` in your fork. Then, simply provide your fork as a data
source. For example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "policy": [
        "git::https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies.git//policy"
      ],
      "data": [
        "git::https://github.com/lcarva/ec-policies.git//data"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

It is also possible to provide an link:https://www.conftest.dev/sharing/[OPA bundle]
as a data source, for example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "policy": [
        "git::https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies.git//policy"
      ],
      "data": [
        "oci::quay.io/lucarval/policy-data:latest"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

NOTE: If the data source contains policy rules, those will be ignored.

NOTE: If you replace the default data source entirely, you must provide the full set of required data values.
These are all the values defined in
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:attachment$rule_data.yml[data/rule_data.yml] and
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:attachment$acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml[data/acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml].

NOTE: It's also possible to add an additional data source containing rule data
defined under the `rule_data_custom` top level key. Data under this key will
take precedence over data defined under the `rule_data` top level key. So, for
example you could use the default data source and still define your own values
for `allowed_registry_prefixes` by adding a second data source that includes
a file such as:

[source,yaml]
----
rule_data_custom:
  allowed_registry_prefixes:
    - trusted-registry.io/trusted-images/
    - docker.io/acme-company/
----
