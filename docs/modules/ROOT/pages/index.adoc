= Enterprise Contract CLI

The EC CLI is used to evaluate Enterprise Contract policies for Software Supply Chain.
Various sub-commands can be used to assert facts about an artifact such as:

* Validating container image signature
* Validating container image provenance
* Evaluating Enterprise Contract {pol}[policies] over the container image provenance
* Fetching artifact authorization

This documentation includes xref:ec.adoc[EC Command Line reference
documentation], and documentation on the
xref:verify-enterprise-contract.adoc[Verify Enterprise Contract Task]
used to run the EC in a Tekton pipeline.
